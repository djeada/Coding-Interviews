# CodingInterviews
My alternative solutions to problems from Harry He's book "Coding Interviews".

<h1>Motivation</h1>

"Coding Interviews" is an excellent book for anyone preparing for a coding job.
While reading it, I couldn't help but notice how much has changed in the way you write C++ code.
Many solutions were actually written in C and disguised as C++.
I thought it would be a fantastic idea to modernize the solutions.
Plus you never learn something until you implement it yourself.

The things I tried to change:

- Exceptions instead of error codes.
- "iostream" instead of "stdlib.h".
- Assertions insread of console tests.
- Vectors instead of bare arrays.
- Iterators instead of int counter.
- Collecions implemented with classes.
- Refrences instead of pointers.
- Lambdas for private functions.

My improvements are only minor and can be further developed, especially with C++20.

Note: 
- not all problems from the book have solutions in this repository.
- not all solutions in this repository are for the problems found in the book.
