/*
 * Arrow and Dot Showcase
 *
 * This program demonstrates how to access class members using both the dot (.) and
 * arrow (->) operators in C++. A class "Human" is defined with private and public
 * members. We create an object (accessed via the dot operator) and a pointer to an object
 * (accessed via the arrow operator). The program also uses the scope resolution operator (::)
 * to call a static member function.
 *
 * ASCII Illustration:
 *
 *       +--------------+
 *       |    Human     |
 *       +--------------+
 *       | - age        |
 *       | - occupation |
 *       | + name       |
 *       +--------------+
 *             |
 *   +---------+---------+
 *   |                   |
 * Object             Pointer
 * (dot operator)     (arrow operator)
 *
 * Example Output:
 * Name: Jim
 * Jim of age 13 is doing something.
 * Jim works as a Student.
 * Name: Tom
 * Tom of age 24 is doing something.
 * Tom works as a Engineer.
 * Tom works as a Data Scientist.
 * Jim is 13 years old.
